# Article-Recommendation-System

Welcome to the **Article Recommendation System**! <br> It allows you to input an article title or body and retrieves the 10 most similar articles based on content similarity. ü§ñ‚ú®

## Key Features:

- **Input Flexibility:** Search by article title or body.
- **Similarity Matching:** Returns the top 10 most similar articles.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to navigate and get results.

## ‚ú® How It Works

The Article Recommendation System processes articles to provide relevant recommendations based on a user query. <br><br> Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the file `article-recommender.py`:

1. **Text Cleaning:** The `TextCleaner` class uses `CountVectorizer` to convert the input query into a set of words, creating a vocabulary.

2. **Article Processing:** The `process_articles` function reads articles from a JSON file, ensuring each article contains essential information (title, text, author, etc.). Cleaned articles are stored for further processing.

3. **Score Calculation:** For each article, the `calculate_score` function compares the query against the article's text, calculating a similarity score based on the frequency of words from the vocabulary found in the article.

4. **Generating Recommendations:** The main function processes the articles, computes their scores, and sorts them to identify the top 10 articles most similar to the query. It outputs the recommendations as a JSON object containing titles, claps, reading times, links, and authors.

This approach leverages natural language processing techniques to deliver relevant content based on user input, making it a powerful tool for article discovery!
